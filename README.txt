The Simple Calculator is an Android application
and as the name suggests it is a calculator app.

This app covers all of the edge cases (like a user trying to divide by zero)
and it produces precise results (by using BigDecimal objects to 
calculate the user's results) so the end user can simply focus on
getting their result and moving forward with their day.

If you would like to try out this application, simply download the APK
file from: (app, release, app-release.apk).

The bulk of the code is located at: (app, src, main, java, MainActivity.java);
most of the code is straight forward except for the equalsBtn onClick function
so please read through the comments in that function if you desire to get a better
understanding of how it works.


*** This app is now available in the Google Play Store. ***
To find it please search

This searching method allows you to search by publisher name
because there are too many calculator apps out there.
