The Simple Calculator is an Android application
and as the name suggests it is a calculator app.

The bulk of the code is located at: (app, src, main, java, MainActivity.java);
most of the code is straight forward except for the equalsBtn onClick function
so please read through the comments in that function if you desire to get a better
understanding of how it works.

This application will soon be available in the Google Play Store.
