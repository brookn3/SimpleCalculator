The Simple Calculator is an Android application
and as the name suggests it is a calculator app.

This app covers all of the edge cases (like a user trying to divide by zero)
and it produces precise results by using BigDecimal objects to 
calculate the user's results. But this is all taken care of for
the users so they can get the correct results and keep moving.

If you would like to try out this application, simply download the APK
file from: (app, release, app-release.apk).

The bulk of the code is located at: (app, src, main, java, MainActivity.java);
most of the code is straight forward except for the equalsBtn onClick function
so please read through the comments in that function if you desire to get a better
understanding of how it works.

*** This application will soon be available in the Google Play Store. ***
